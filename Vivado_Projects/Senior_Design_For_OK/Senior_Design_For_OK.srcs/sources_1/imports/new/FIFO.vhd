--The FIFO operates on two clocks. The FIFO write clock, and the USB read clock. 
--Data is written to the FIFO when:
      --The FIFO is not full -> the read address pointer and the write address pointer are unequal
      --Only on the rising edge of the FIFO write clock
--Data is read from the FIFO when:
      --The FIFO still contains iterms that have not been read
      --Only on the rising edge of the usb_read_clk and when the read_en signal is 1 
--On each read or write, only a single row in the FIFO is onsidered. All bits in the row are written to/read in parallel.
